# Project Description:

I have created Rakib Quiz project using `npx create-react-app b6-quiz-crackerz-rakibulinux` and then install some npm packages like react-router, react-toastify, and recharts to make my work perfect. Then created some components inside of the components folder also added a router file inside of the loaders folder. After this I focused on my API load work. API loaded via react-router loader also used react context API to make my work faster.
